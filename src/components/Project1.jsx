                The only all-in-one platform that connects amateur and professional musicians to orchestras that need
                vacancies filled in the post-covid landscape.

                Groups can make a profile, post/update upcoming concerts, their requirements and whether they'll offer financial help to players.

                Players can filter results based on location, instrument and date added.

                This is a full CRUD application that incorporates user authentication, RESTful API design and error handling. It is also fully end-to-end tested.

                I built this because currently there is no such platform available to cater specifically to musicians and their needs.
                The scope of the project is much larger though, and in the future I hope to expand the reach to choirs, smaller groups and even non-classical musicians.
