                The only all-in-one platform that connects amateur and professional musicians to orchestras that need
                vacancies filled in the post-covid landscape.

                This is a full CRUD application that incorporates user authentication, RESTful API design and error handling. It is also fully end-to-end tested.

                I built this because there currently is not such a platform available to cater specifically for musicians and their needs.
                The scope of the project is much larger though, and in the future I hope to expand the reach to choirs, smaller groups and even non-classical musicians.
