                Being incredibly self-motivated to learn and keep up to date, I make sure I use the best tools available to create

                My projects go for a mobile-first approach. The majority of users will be looking at content on a smaller screen,
                so making sure it looks good regardless of the device is my number one priority!

                Making sure I fully understand or that I can explain what I am doing is paramount to the success of my projects. 
                With so many years in education, I can break down concepts and get it accross regarldess of my audience.
